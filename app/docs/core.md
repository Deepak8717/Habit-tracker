# Leverage: Core

## Why This Exists

Leverage applies controlled pressure to move systems. That includes you. One slot at a time, one promise at a time—you apply force, and the system records it. Over time, the record becomes momentum. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about load-bearing identity.

> **Core function:** accumulate meaningful pressure over time—without collapse, without forgetting. The lever remembers.

## Core Mechanics

- **Effort Compounds**  
  You don’t reset. You accrue. The system penalizes missed reps—but it doesn’t reset.

- **Time-Slot Based**  
  Your unit of pressure is a slot: 1 hour, 2 hours, a day or twice a week flexible. You define the shape of your lever.

- **Commitments as Leverage Points**  
  Each one is a deliberate promise. Not a behavior. Not a hope. A commitment.

- **Plasticity Engine**  
  This isn’t a diary. It’s a system for rewiring. You change by applying effort repeatedly, not by reflecting endlessly.

- **Custom Scoring Physics**  
  Each commitment defines its own logic: when it rewards, when it penalizes, how steep the curve gets.

- **Sovereign Memory**  
  No sync required. All data is local. You own the trace of your applied force.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Functions declared first, called last
- Logic separated from interface
- Components modular, replaceable
- Code should invite evolution, not resist it
- Nothing is locked in—this is scaffolding, not infrastructure

## System Layout

- `/store`: slot data, commitment registry, score engine
- `/ui/popups`: interfaces for applying effort
- `/calendar`: visual map of force applied over time
- `/firebase.js`: isolated optional sync layer
- `/main.js`: system boot and orchestration
