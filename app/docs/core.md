# Leverage

A commitment tracking system that accumulates effort instead of resetting it.

## Why This Exists

I built this because sobriety apps broke me. One relapse and they reset your counter to zero. That crushing reset often triggered another relapse—the shame spiral where one bad day erased weeks of effort.

That felt wrong. Even in sobriety, where moderation isn't the goal, your past efforts shouldn't vanish because you slipped once. So I designed my own system: **accumulative scoring, like an accounting book**. It tracks cumulative effort. It marginally penalizes skips but never erases your work.

Slowly, I expanded this beyond sobriety, commitments, habits, showing up. The system rewards daily points, punish marignally for skipping and pulls you back through accumulated effort. **One failure can't override the whole record.**

**The score remembers when you forget. It holds your thread when everything else unravels.**
Core function: accumulate meaningful pressure over time—without collapse, without forgetting. The lever remembers.

## The Dual Purpose

**1. Mechanical Leverage** - You don’t reset. You accrue. Each commitment is a deliberate promise, each slot a unit of applied force. The system penalizes missed reps but doesn’t reset—because real change compounds, it doesn’t restart.

**2. Existential Proof** - Sometimes you crawl. Sometimes you stagger. Life stalls, but this system doesn’t. The score reminds you: not just methamatically but visually too. you are moving. The brain forgets, emotions distort, but the score remembers. In dark seasons, that's not trivial—it's survival.

## The Evolution: From Proof to Mirror

**Phase 1: Survival Mode**
Right now, the system is your evidence. It cuts through emotional fog and proves you're not stagnant. It accumulates small gestures of self-care, micro-commitments, tiny acts of showing up. The question is simple: _Did you move today?_

**Phase 2: Quality Confrontation**
Once the structure is solid, once you trust the rhythm, the system evolves. It stops just comforting and starts confronting. The question shifts: _Did it matter? Did you show up fully, or just barely?_

This is when the score becomes a mirror instead of a crutch. When it reflects not just effort, but intention. Not just movement, but direction.

## Core Mechanics

- **Commitments = Promises**  
  Small, deliberate. Not aspirations—decisions.

- **Slots = Units of Force**  
  Time given to those promises. Flexible. Yours to define.

- **Score = Accumulated Truth**  
  Not a feel-good number. A record of motion—up, down, honest. A small hit of clarity. Just enough dopamine to keep you going.

- **Memory = Continuity**  
  You don’t reset. You accrue. The system remembers your pressure—even when you don’t.

## What It Teaches Me

- **Choosing is enough (sometimes)**  
  You showed up. That alone means something.

- **One missed day doesn’t erase you**  
  You’re not back to zero. This isn’t punishment. The system decays gently—but never resets.

- **Resistance is feedback**  
  Avoidance is data. Something needs to shift.

- **Seasons change**  
  Survival. Growth. Confusion. The score adapts. You just keep moving.

- **Cut the mental fog**
  Sometime the progress is not visible. It reminds you of your progress through heatmaps, numbers and charts, prevent you spiraling into negetive thoughts.

**The score holds your continuity when your mind fragments it.**
Later, when you're stronger, it will hold your accountability when your comfort zone would contain you.

## Not About Productivity

This isn’t a habit tracker. It’s a system for holding pressure without collapse. A way to keep going even when motivation fails. To keep choosing—even when you don’t feel like it.

> **The lever holds steady. Even when you don’t.**

## How It’s Built

- No cloud. No sharing. No noise.  
  Just you, your effort, your memory.

- Built for evolution: starts primitive, stays flexible  
  Minimal architecture. Modular code. Local-first by design.

- Gamified, slightly—because movement should feel alive  
  Tiny feedback hits. Not to addict—but to affirm: _you moved._

## Technical Foundation

**Simple Architecture**

- Commitments: promises you make to your own continuity
- Slots: units of time where you prove you're still choosing
- Score: accumulated evidence of persistent selfhood
- Memory: your objective witness across emotional seasons

**Evolutionary Design**
The system starts simple—almost primitive—because that's what survival requires. But it's built to evolve. To deepen. To eventually become the mirror that reflects not just your effort, but your authentic engagement with your own life.

**Sovereign Data**
Your proof belongs to you. No sync required. No external validation needed. This is your private conversation with your own persistence.
